\textbf{Abstract: }
Computer networks have increasingly stood out as a fundamental sector in various aspects of society. With its popularization the Internet has become part of people's daily lives, in which many services' conversions to the digital space were accelerated, evident by the rising use of these networks, such as the increase in traffic and drastic changes in the services offered to the users. Web browsing was once considered the dominant Internet traffic and video applications are projected to reach over 82\% of all Internet traffic in 2022. These statistics places HTTP traffic as an important element in the traffic generator scenario. Thus, the project aims to develop a traffic generator for the HTTP protocol, which allows both the study of the protocol in question, and its uses in studies of other aspects of communication network, acting as input traffic for other types of studies such as resources allocation.\\
