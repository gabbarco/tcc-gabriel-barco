\textbf{Abstract: }
OpenLDAP is an open-source directory service that enables user authentication and management in a network. This software can be installed alongside a server to handle information about users, groups, permissions, and other resources within it. The objective of this project is to install and configure this system as an alternative to Microsoft's Active Directory (which involves higher installation costs due to its license) and to administer users and other features provided by the tool. Additionally, this project aims to explore the feasibility of this software in a small-scale network, analyzing its scalability and flexibility. The employed methodology will involve the installation and configuration of OpenLDAP on a Debian virtual machine hosted in a Proxmox environment. The purpose is to authenticate and manage user accounts for members of the "PET Computação IFTM Campus Ituiutaba", providing user-friendly access and efficiently allocating machine resources through this tool.\\
